    <h1>A Day in the Life of an Echo</h1>
    <p></p>
    <h2>What is it Like to be an Echo?</h2>
    <p>People shout your name a <b>lot</b>. Everyone thinks they're being original, but if you've been hearing the same jokes since kindergarten, it's still not funny fifteen years later.</p>
    <p>On the upside, though, it's really easy to make jokes about yourself. "Is  there an Echo in here?" <b>ba-dum chsh</b></p>
    <h2>What does an Echo do on her Spare Time?</h2>
    <p>Honestly, Echoes don't get much spare time. If they do, it's because they're neglecting to do something else. Whether it be homework for Visual Design classes, Mentor work for snyamncut's 3rd floor Computer Sciences and Engineering LLC, or working their assigned office shifts at snyamncut's front desk, there is very little time in the day to do anything else.</p>
    <h3>If the Echo did have the Fabled "Spare-Time", what would they do?</h3>
    <p>Echo Kane enjoys being artistic and using her imagination. She likes painting and drawing, 3D animation, and even once modeled a flying dragon using elmers glue, puffy paint, and toothpicks. She also enjoys reading, playing the Sims (and a few other computer games) and beating her boyfriend at Mario Kart and some other Wii games (which he <b>hates</b>).</p>
    
    <h2>How Old is an Echo?</h2>
    <p>This particular Echo is 21 years old. 21 years of people asking "How did your parents choose your name?" and "Are your parents hippies?" It's amazing in fact. Most other people don't recieve the Spanish Inquisition for their name, but as soon as someone walks up with an uncommon word that they just so happen to respond to, and they get the third-degree about it.</p>
    <h2>Why is this Echo going to Eastern?</h2>
    <p>Since high school, Echo Kane has enjoyed 3D animation and would love to pursue a career in it. Eastern Washington University has an excellent 3D animation set of classes, and Echo was initially going to get a degree in Computer Science with the animation minor. The more she coded in java, the more she realized that a programming degree was not for her. After looking into Visual Communication Design (VSD), Echo realized that it was a much better fit and still kept her minor. She is a senior in credits because she took advantage of Running Start in High School, but this is her first official quarter as a VCD student.</p>
